Simple project that uses sklearn to run some basic classifiers on this Dow Jones market data.

It runs Linear Regression and SVM as the classifiers. It uses next weeks closing price as the
label. After training (on 500 of the 700 examples), it tests on the last 200. It loops through
them and predicts on those, and only if we predict an increase in the price (that is next weeks
close is higher than this weeks close), we count it as a "buy" and will add it to our money
spent, and we add the next weeks close price to the money we have at the end.

Very simple example, just wanted to take a quick look at sklearn and some of the classifiers.

USAGE:

Just clone the repo, and run python naive.py and you will get a printout of the "profits" for
the Linear Regression model and the SVM model.
